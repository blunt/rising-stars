## About Make-A-Wish® Canada
Make-A-Wish® creates life-changing wishes for children with critical illness. We are on a quest to bring eligible child’s wish to life,  because a wish is an integral part of a child’s treatment journey. Research shows children who have wishes granted can built the physical and emotional strength they need to fight their illness. Make-A-Wish’s vision is to reach every eligible child.

#### The Impact of a Wish
When children are battling a critical illness, so much of normal childhood is taken away from them — it is exhausting, both emotionally and physically. A Wish is something that gives kids the opportunity to look outside their illness — it restores a sense of childhood back to the child and normalcy back to the family
