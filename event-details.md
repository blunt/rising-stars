## Use of Funds
All funds raised by this event will be donated to Make-a-Wish® Canada to grant wishes for children living with critical illness in the Greater Toronto Area. When children are battling a critical illness, so much of normal childhood is taken away from them - it is exhausting, both emotionally and physically. A Wish is something that gives kids the opportunity to look outside their illness - it restores a sense of childhood back to the child and normalcy back to the family and is an integral part of a child’s treatment journey. Research shows that children who have wishes granted can build the physical and emotional strength needed to fight their illnesses.
